# Brain-tumor-detection-using-machine-learning-methods
The advancement of the computerized methods
had a great impact over medical diagnosis particularly on the
automated system for tumor detection from brain MR images.
Manual processing of the brain MR images for the detection
of the abnormal tissue is a tedious and time-consuming task
and are highly prone to errors due to the presence of high
diversity in the appearance of the tumor tissue among a different
number of patient and chances of confusion between normal and
abnormal tissue is very high thus the automated system is highly
appreciated. Automated systems work through first taking the
input MR images of the brain then pre-processing of the images
for removal of the noise as an important step in biomedical image
processing. Diagnosis of the brain tumor through MR image
hampered due to the presence of the artifacts and skull and the
removal of these two is seen as an important step. The next
most vital task is segmentation via some important segmentation
methods viz. Fuzzy C-Means, Artificial Neural Network, Region
Growing, and clustering to distinct the tumor from the normal
tissue.
